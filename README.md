# Celtra challenge - HTML5 game

This game is being developed to enter Celtra's HTML5 game challenge.


## About the project

The game is being developed using [dart language](https://www.dartlang.org/).

I'm using dart because it has promising features to battle issues that occur when working with
JavaScript and other transpilers.

It has *optional* typing system, offers true object oriented design and great on-run error reporting,
to name a few.

Also, Dart development tema [claims](https://www.dartlang.org/performance/) dart runs faster or at
least just as fast as corresponding JavaScript.
